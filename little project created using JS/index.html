      <h2>Why javascript?</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a scripting language used to develop web pages. Developed
        in Netscape, JS allows developers to create a dynamic and interactive
        web page to interact with visitors and execute complex actions.

      <p>
        It also enables users to load content into a document without reloading
        the entire page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most websites use JavaScript for validation and to support external
        applications, including PDF documents, widgets, flash applications.

        Various JavaScript frameworks are used for developing and building
        robust web applications. In an application like Google Maps, if users
        want to explore a map, all they have to do is click and drag the mouse
        to get a detailed view.
